qNetVO
======

*The Quantum Network Variational Optimizer (qNetVO) is python framework for
simulating and optimizing quantum communication networks using
quantum hardware.*

Features
========

Simulate Quantum Communication Networks on Quantum Computers:

* Create quantum circuits that model distributed quantum communication devices.
* Combine devices to flexibly construct quantum communication network simulations. 
* Execute ansatz circuits on quantum computing platforms and simulators.

Optimize Quantum Communication Networks using Variational Techniques:

* Train quantum communication networks like neural networks using differential programming.
* Use our library of communication oriented cost functions or create your own.

Powered by `PennyLane <https://pennylane.ai>`_:

* Free and open-source framework for cross-platform quantum machine learning.
