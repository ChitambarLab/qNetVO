n-Local Star Inequality
=======================

.. currentmodule:: qnetvo

The :math:`n`-local star network consists of :math:`n` entanglement sources (static preparation nodes) and :math:`n+1` measurement nodes where one central node holds one qubit from each source and the remaining :math:`n` nodes are connected to the central node through a single source.
The network forms an :math:`n` point star. 
Polynomial Bell inequalities can be derivied that tightly bound the set of classical correlations
[Tavakoli2014]_.
These :math:`n`-local star Bell inequalities witness quantum violations to the classical
:math:`n`-local set and can be used to optimize non-:math:`n`-locality in star configurations.
