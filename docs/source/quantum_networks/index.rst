Quantum Networks
================

A quantum communication network is a collection of quantum devices
linked by quantum communication.
Many important systems can be viewed as a quantum network, for example,
a cluster of quantum computers or a long-range optics communication network.
Quantum networks have important advantages in distributed information processing,
multipartite cryptography, and distributed sensing.
