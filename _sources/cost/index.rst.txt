Cost Functions
==============

A cost function quantifies the performance of the quantum network at a particular task.
A cost function is evaluated for a given network ansatz and settings.
In general, a quantum network cost function requires one or more executions of a PennyLane
QNode.

For convenience, we provide example cost functions for quantum networks.
Custom cost functions can be implemented using PennyLane.
